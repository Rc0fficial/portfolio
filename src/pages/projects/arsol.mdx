**Description:**

During my internship at Arsol, I contributed to the development of the Horizan Labs website. My key responsibilities included:

- **Frontend Development:** Built responsive layouts using React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring compatibility across devices.
- **API Integration:** Connected the frontend with backend services to fetch and display dynamic content.
- **UI/UX Design:** Implemented user-friendly interfaces that enhance user engagement and experience.

This experience honed my skills in frontend development and strengthened my ability to work on professional projects.
